# Create program that produces name of Cities. Prints name of favorite city
# Requirements:
#   Must use a function
#    Has a function named favorite_city
#    favorite_city should have one parameter: name
#    call favorite_city at least 3 times
#    output should include: "One of my favorite cities is"

# Lessons learned - 
    no need to print a function call if the function call has a print statement.
    returning a value adds the value to the function call only if you're assigning the function to a variable



#Draft
def favorite_city(name):
    print("One of my favorite cities is: ")
    return (name)

#a = favorite_city("PR")
#c = favorite_city("MA")
#b = favorite_city("MD")

#print(a, b, c)

print(favorite_city("PR"))
print(favorite_city("MD"))
print(favorite_city("MA"))


# Updated after reviewing the solution
def favorite_city(name):
    print("One of my favorite cities is: ", name)

favorite_city("PR")
favorite_city("MD")
favorite_city("MA")
