#choice of 1 MM or .01 double every day for 30 days
#doubling calc
#5th day .01* (2**5) = .32 dollars

#Lessons Learned
#    hard to come up with variable names
#    crazy to think about how many different ways there must be to do the same thing
#    math is required

penny = .01
#day_doubled = int(input("How many days have passed? "))
day_doubled = 30
result_exp = 2**day_doubled
result_final = penny * result_exp

print(result_final)
